## About me

I am currently working full time in the ICT4G Unit of Fondazione Bruno Kessler as project manager and full-stack Ruby on Rails developer of <a href="http://www.bringfood.org">BringTheFood</a>, a mobile and web application to fight food waste. I have been also actively involved in managing a EU-funded mobility project with South Africa as well as in writing EU proposals.

I obtained my PhD degree from the University of Trento in April 2014 with a thesis on the development of a Maturity Model for ICT for Development projects. I received a double degree in Computer Science from Georgia Tech (Atlanta, GA) and the University of Trento (cum laude) in 2010.

I have been working with various web frameworks, especially Ruby on Rails and Javascript based. More recently I have been also playing with Angular and the Chrome API. My interests include Agile Software Development, Web Technologies, ICT for Development, Living Labs, Social Innovation and Project Management.
