Some other things I like to do

### Homebrewing

I started making my own beer in 2012 thanks to the suggestion of a dear friend. Nothing fancy (kit-based with some customizations) but it's quite fun and rewarding. If you live in Northern Italy I can recommend [Pinta.it](http://www.pinta.it) to get started or get all the ingredients you need (they supply homebrewers as well as professional micro-breweries).

### Minimalist hiking

Living so close to the Alps, it is quite common to spend some time hiking. In the last years I ditched the "traditional" approach of heavy gear and heavy boots in favor of a more natural way of exploring our mountains. Long story short, now I'm one of those guys with the strange toe shoes. Want to find out more? Check out [this blog](http://www.trekminimal.in) (work in progress) by a friend of mine and myself.

### Travels

<p class="travel">
Like you, I like to travel around the world and I'm lucky enough to have the chance to travel for work. So I decided to use the space below to brag a bit. You can also check out my <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/members-reviews/Aaron-sama">reviews</a> and <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/members/Aaron-sama">profile</a> on TripAdvisor.
